					<p><span class="qamplus">QAM<span>Plus</span></span> was founded in 2015 to market its QA test automation software.

It has added several new features based on customer feedback, and has continued to add new customers month over month all by word of mouth.</p>

			<h3>History</h3>
			<p>For most of its existence, this was a three-man company supporting a product concept. It kept a very conservative stance on products trying to iterate based on beta customer feedback, zero advertising to date, with marketing depending mainly on word of mouth. <br>
			We have focused heavily on getting the website up and running to make it easy for developers to sign up with a free trial, test the service, enjoy it and convert to a paid subscription account.  Once they have introduced the service within their organization we have the opportunity to upsell the account to add additional features and expand to additional use cases.  This is why we are looking to add additional developers to bring new features to market and new sales reps to build an outbound sales machine.</p>
